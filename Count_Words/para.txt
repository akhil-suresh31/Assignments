Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I'm fallin' so I'm taking my time on my ride
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I'm fallin' so I'm taking my time on my ride
Takin' my time on my ride
I've been thinking too much
I've been thinking too much
I've been thinking too much
I've been thinking too much ( Help me)
I've been thinking too much (I've been thinking too much)
I've been thinking too much ( Help me)
I've been thinking too much (I've been thinking too much)
I've been thinking too much
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I'm fallin' so I'm taking my time on my ride
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I'm fallin' so I'm taking my time
Takin' my time on my ride
Whoa, oh, oh
