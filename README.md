## Descriptions :

### 1. Random number generator :
   This program takes a user input(n) , and generates a random number between 0 and (n-1).
   The function retrieves the system time (time elapsed since January 1 ,1970 in milliseconds) and then gets the remainder when that time is divided by n.
   #### Shortcomings: 
   Since this program is dependant on time , if called multiple times for same n it will produce same no. because the speed of execution of modern processor is so good.

### 2. Perfect number finder :
   This program prints all the perfect number between 1 - n(user input). Perfect number, a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors.
   Example 6(3x2,2,3,1x6) 3+2+1 = 6 .
   
### 3. Count Occurences of each digits :
   Given a string input from the user, this program calculates the occurences of each digit and prints it.
   
### 4. Character is alphabet or not :
   Simple program to check if the entered character is alphabet or not.
   
### 5. Count the number of digits :
   Given a number by the user, the program return the no, of digits there are in the input.
   
### 6. Matrix multiplication :
